Answers for some common programming tests, done with test-driven development
using [phpspec](http://phpspec.net/). Each problem is described in the 
README.md in that folder. To run tests, 
[get composer](https://getcomposer.org/), then:

```bash
# cd into the directory you want such as:
cd file
composer install
vendor/bin/phpspec run
```
